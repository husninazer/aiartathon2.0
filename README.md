### Project AI Artathon 2.0

This repository serves a generative artwork, a website displaying some of that artwork. The majority of the work can be found in the `sketches/` directory. 
`index.html` provides an entry point for the project, where the `script` tag at the bottom determines which sketch will be viewed.


#### Dependancies
[p5js](https://p5js.org/)

[ml5js](https://ml5js.org/)


### Sample Display
![Alt Text](sample/sample.gif)



### Setup


```bash
npm install
```

To run the server locally:

```bash
npm start
```

The sketch will then be live on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Change the script tag at the bottom of `index.html` to switch sketches to whatever file you want. The webpage will automatically reload when saving files.
